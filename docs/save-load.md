#Save Load Docs
##Overview

The __Runtime Save & Load__ (RTSL) subsystem is needed for saving and managing scenes, assets and projects at runtime. Logically, it consists of three main parts:
 
 * [Persistent Classes](#persistent-classes) - this part allows you to choose what to serialize and generate persistent classes for serialization. 
 * [Asset Libraries](#asset-library) - this part allows you to create and manage assets, as well as provide information to the RTSL to identify these assets.
 * [Project](#project) - this part provides api to interact with RTSL.

 
!!! note

       RTSL use [protobuf.net](https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net) for serialization.
